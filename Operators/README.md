Introduction to Operators and Computational Thinking

## Ideas to Include
Two primitive variables

Initialize an array instead

Create Primitive Variables to illustrate simple operations, console.log these

Then create a function to summarize this.

Create a skipCount FOR Loop
- by 2, from 0 (Arithmetic Sequence, Linear Function)
- by 3's, starting at 15, backwards (Arithmetic Sequence, Linear Function)
- by x4's, starting at 15, forwards (Geometric Sequence, Linear Function)

Review: FOR Loop and variables in terms of actual arithmetic sequences
- Create a sentence that uses the parameters to mimic the arithmetic sequence, described by the arguments
- Write the sentence as a comment & instructions for the function

To Do
- Simple Comparisons, include simple operator until IF Statement evaluates to true
  - Notice this was already included in the FOR Loop for incrementing the index
- Strict and Loose Equality (string vs. number example)
- Not Equality, and utility in the "opposite", or Euler Diagram of Not (demonstrate this)
- Ternary Operator (Gold-Silver Example)
- Falsy: default and user-initiated
- Biswise Example: read, write, execute permissions
- Modulus: even or odd (Odd or Even Number example)

- Simple Comparisons (Example: Simple function of arithmetic sequence, re-called in a WHILE Loop until condition evaluates to true)
  - "How many times does it take to skipCount to 100 if you start at 5 and skip count by 4's?"
  - Solution: use the skipCounting function and a WHILE Loop with a conditional
  - Note: this is different than a FOR Loop since we do not know how many times this will repeat
- Notice this was already included in the FOR Loop for incrementing the index
- Strict and Loose Equality (string vs. number example)
- Not Equality, and utility in the "opposite", or Euler Diagram of Not
- Ternary Operator (Gold-Silver Example)
